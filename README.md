# Interactive-Geographic-Mapping-Project

Description: Developed an interactive geographic mapping project using Python's folium library to visualize geographical data. The project was divided into three main components:

Volcano Map:

Created an interactive map displaying the locations of volcanoes with elevation-based color-coding.
Implemented pop-up information for each volcano marker to provide details about the volcanoes.
Enabled users to switch between volcano and population data layers.
Extended Volcano and Population Map:

Extended the initial volcano map by incorporating a population data layer using GeoJSON files.
Styled countries based on population levels, enhancing the visual representation of data.
Added a layer control feature to allow users to switch between volcano and population data.
Custom Volcano Map with Icons:

Designed a custom volcano map with visually appealing green icons for volcano markers.
Implemented informative pop-up information for each marker, displaying volcano names and elevation.
Created an engaging and user-friendly mapping experience.
